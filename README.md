## Introduction

Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models to improve the performance of machine learning tasks with limited data. This notebook implements transfer learning using popular architectures such as VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you will need to install the required packages. You can do this by creating a virtual environment and installing the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `ImageClassificationTransferLearning.ipynb` and follow the instructions within the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

3. Modify the dataset paths and parameters as needed to suit your specific use case.
